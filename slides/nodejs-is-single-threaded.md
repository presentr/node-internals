##  Node.js is single threaded *...sort of* <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

  In order to achieve concurrency, we need to defer slow tasks like IO <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  
  So.... how can Node.js defer something inside a single thread? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
